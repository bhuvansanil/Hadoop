problem: find the kms traveleld each day using pigscript

kms_data = load '/kms' as (day:int,kms:int);
filtkmsfirst = filter kms_data by day == 1; 
otherkmsdata = filter kms_data by day != 1;
addplus1 = foreach kms_data generate kms,(day + 1) as addedday;
joindata = join otherkmsdata by day,addplus1 by addedday;
formated = foreach joindata generate $0 as day,$1 as kmsday1,$2 as kmsday2

finalrpt = foreach formated generate day,(kmsday1 - kmsday2) as eachdaykms;
joinfinalrpt = union filtkmsfirst,finalrpt

output

(1,120)
(2,10)
(3,30)
(4,20)
(5,10)
(6,40)
(7,160)
(8,30)
(9,10)
(10,1)



wht if data is as below

day1	100
day2	140
day3	150
day4	180
day5	190
day6	200
day7	220
day8	250
day9	290
day10	304

kmsdata =  load '/kms2' as (day:chararray,kms:int);
kmsrank = rank kmsdata by day;


filtkmsfirst = filter kmsrank by rank_kmsdata == 1;
removerank = foreach filtkmsfirst generate day,kms; 
otherkmsdata = filter kmsrank by rank_kmsdata != 1;

addplus1 = foreach kmsrank generate kms,day,(rank_kmsdata + 1) as addedday;
joindata = join otherkmsdata by rank_kmsdata,addplus1 by addedday;

formated = foreach joindata generate $1 as day,$2 as currentkms,$3 as prevkms

finalrpt = foreach formated generate day,(currentkms - prevkms) as eachdaykms;
joinfinalrpt = union removerank,finalrpt;
